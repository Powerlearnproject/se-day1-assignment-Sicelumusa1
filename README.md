#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

    It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to build a high quality software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

    1. (1960s) The establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
    2. (1970s) Structured programing
    3. (2000s) Agile methodologies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  0. Requirements: The customer requirements are studied and documentent
  1. Design: These are schematics of how the software will look like on its completion. It includes the software architecture and the user interface
  2. Development: This is the implementation/coding of the software components
  3. Testing: The software is tested if it does and look the way it was intended
  4. Deployment: This is releasing the software to the customer or user
  5. Maintenace: This is continuos support of the sorftware to enhance if after it has been given to the customer. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

    Waterfall is sequential and rigid whilst Agile is iterative and flexible.

    Waterfall has distinct phases completed in order whilst Agile emphasizes continuous feedback and adaptation

    Waterfall focuses on thorough planning and execution in predetermined stages whilst Agile promotes ongoing collaboration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

    Software Developer: Writing the code and developing the developing the entire software product

    Quality Assurance Engineer: Create tests that identify issues with the software before it is deployed

    Project Manager: Helps the team design,execute, monitor and finish their work so that the clients will receive high-quality software products.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

    1. IDEs e.g VSCode, PyCharm, Eclipse: Boost productivity, improve code accuracy, source-code editor, debugging and troubleshooting

    2. VCS github, gitlab, dockerhub: collaboration, coparing earlier versions of the code, detailes activity tracking, storing versions, traceability

    What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

    1. Development Velocity: This is a measure of how to speed up the development and reduce time to market. This needs code reviews to ensure the code passes to QA hardly returns for correction. Also frequent deployments of completed features

    2. Scalability: The software must be designed to enable scalability

    3. Burnout: The well-being of the developers is important for productivily. Flexability in the team should be permited

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    Unit Testing: This is the test performed to the smallest component of the code of the software. It is used by developers to avoid issues like
    syntax and logical errors. This test is important to speeding up the development process, avoiding sending simple errors to Quality Assurance Engineers.

    Integration testing: Is testing if the software components and able to perform the intended task when there are integrated. It is important to ensure that the software does want it is designed to do.

    System Testing: Im an end-to-end testing. This is where the software is tested as a whole. Here every mistake that can be done by software users is tested.
    It is important to make sure that the software can handle all eventualities without breaking.

    Acceptance: This is where a customer is given a cold run to see if the developed software is according to their specification. If adjustments are required the customer will communicate.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    It is a way of ensuring that AI models produce accurate and relevent outputs. It's the art of crafting effective prompts that guide the model's behavior, ensuring effective human-AI communication. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

    Vague prompt: Selenium in web scraping
    Concise prompt: Provide step-by-step selenuim methods for scraping javascript driven websites.
